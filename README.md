# ChatProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.4.

## At first

After you download a project, you need to add Angular CLI first.

This means you can just run `npm install -g @angular/cli` at your console to get a global install of the latest CLI release. 

Then run `npm i` to get all of `node-modules`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
